Renderer meant to be fast and realtime
Uses Phong for light intensity calcs
working on dynamically adjustable BVH rn(hopefully almost done)
smooth/realistic shadows that utilize gaussian blur(intensity dependent on distance from object casting shadow)
colors are planned to be lerped with colors calculated by a low-res path tracer
